# VM-Fleet-Commander
This project demonstrates how to deploy and manage Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and Bicep. It includes setting up resource groups, VMs, and associated networking resources while following best practices for maintainability and security.

Overview:

Azure Services Used:

- Azure Virtual Machines: Provision and manage virtual machines.
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM): Manage infrastructure through templates.
- Bicep: A domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively.

Project Steps:

1. Initial Setup:
    - Ensure Azure CLI with Bicep support is installed.
    - Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes in Bicep and ARM templates.

2. Bicep Basics:
    - Learn the basics of Bicep syntax and structure.
    - Convert basic ARM templates to Bicep to understand differences.

3. Resource Group and Naming Conventions
    - Create an Azure Resource Group using Bicep.
    - Implement naming conventions for resources using Bicep's string functions.

4. Virtual Machine Provisioning
    - Develop a Bicep module for deploying Azure VMs with parameterized inputs (e.g., VM size, name, region).
    - Use loops in Bicep to deploy multiple VM instances based on a specified count.

5. Network Resources
    - Design Bicep modules for networking resources like Virtual Network, Subnet, and Network Security Groups.
    - Ensure VMs are provisioned within the designated VNet with necessary security rules applied.

6. Parameter Files and Validation
    - Create separate parameter files for different environment deployments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
    - Validate Bicep files using Azure CLI before deployment.

7. Deployment
    - Use Azure CLI to deploy Bicep templates, creating all designated resources.
    - Test reproducibility by deploying infrastructure to different regions or resource groups.

8. Maintenance & Updates:
    - Make changes to Bicep files (e.g., VM size or count) and redeploy, observing how Azure handles updates and maintains state.
    - Regularly update Bicep language and Azure CLI to leverage new features and improvements.

9. Documentation & Cleanup
    - Document Bicep modules, their purpose, and required parameters.
    - Clean up resources or resource groups after testing to avoid unnecessary costs.

Getting Started:

- Clone this repository.
- Set up Azure CLI and Bicep.
- Configure Bicep templates and parameter files.
- Deploy infrastructure using Azure CLI.
- Test and validate deployments.
